**Executive Summary:**

Our SaaS executive dashboard indicates a high overall churn rate of 73.46%, with a significant amount of monthly recurring revenue at risk ($139,130.85). This is a critical issue that requires immediate attention. The high-risk engagement segments reveal that customers with medium and low engagement levels are driving the churn.

**What is happening:**

- A substantial portion of our customers (73.46%) are canceling their subscriptions, resulting in a significant loss of revenue.
- The high-risk engagement segments indicate that customers who are moderately or minimally engaged with our product are more likely to churn.

**Why churn is occurring:**

- Insufficient engagement: Customers who are not actively using our product are more likely to cancel their subscriptions.
- Lack of value perception: Customers may not perceive sufficient value in our product to justify continued subscription.

**Recommended actions for leadership:**

1. **Improve engagement strategies**: Develop targeted campaigns to re-engage customers with medium and low engagement levels, highlighting the value of our product and encouraging them to utilize its features.
2. **Enhance customer experience**: Identify areas for improvement in our product and customer support to ensure that customers feel valued and supported.
3. **Analyze churn causes**: Conduct a thorough analysis to understand the underlying reasons for churn, including product, pricing, and support issues.
4. **Develop retention-focused initiatives**: Implement initiatives to reduce churn and increase customer loyalty, such as loyalty programs, exclusive offers, or personalized support.

By addressing these key areas, leadership can take proactive steps to reduce churn, retain customers, and ultimately drive revenue growth.
